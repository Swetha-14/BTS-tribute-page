            <h3> 1.Most-Viewed YouTube Video in 24 Hours</h3>
            <br>
            <p>On Aug. 27, 2018, BTS released their "IDOL" music video and it accumulated 45 million views in just 24 hours, breaking Taylor Swift's previous record for "Look What You Made Me Do," which reached 43. 2 million in the same timespan.

            Then, on April 12, BTS released their "Boy With Luv" music video and broke the YouTube record again. "Boy With Luv" racked up an impressive 74.6 million views in a single day, nearly twice as much as BTS' previous YouTube record and nearly 20 million more views than the previous record-holders (BLACKPINK with "Kill This Love").</p>

            <br>
            <p>BTS' 2017 American Music Awards performance not only marked the group's U.S. television debut, but also the first time a K-Pop group ever performed on a major U.S. award show.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>3.First K-Pop Group to be Nominated for a Billboard Music Award</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In 2017, BTS was nominated for Top Social Artist at the Billboard Music Awards, making them the first K-Pop group to ever be nominated for a BBMA. They ended up winning the award, breaking Justin Bieber's six-year reign and becoming the first K-Pop group to ever win a BBMA as well.

            In 2019, they became the first K-Pop group to be nominated for a main award at the show when they were nominated for Top Duo/Group, an award they ended up winning (that's another first, btw).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>4.First K-Pop Album to Reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200</h3>
            <br>
            <p>BTS Love Yourself: Tear, released in May 2018, immediately topped the Billboard 200 chart, becoming the first K-Pop album to do so, and only the second K-Pop album to crack the top 10 overall.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>5.First Foreign-Language No. 1 Album Since 2006</h3>
            <br>
            <p>When Love Yourself: Tear reached No. 1 in May 2018, it became the first foreign-language No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 in 12 years. The last foreign-language album to reach No. 1 was II Divo's Ancora album in 2006.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>6.First K-Pop Group to Have a Top 10 Hit on the Billboard Hot 100</h3>
            <br>
            <p>BTS' lead single from Love Yourself: Tear, "Fake Love," debuted at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot 100, making BTS the first K-Pop group ever to have a Top 10 hit on the chart. Since then, BTS topped themselves when their April 2019 single, "Boy With Luv" debuted at No. 8.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>7.First K-Pop Act to Hit No. 1 on the Billboard Artist 100 Chart</h3>
            <br>
            <p>A week after BTS dropped Love Yourself: Tear on May 18, the group went from being No. 4 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart to No. 1. According to Billboard, the Artist 100 chart "measures artist activity across key metrics of music consumption, blending album and track sales, radio airplay, streaming and social media fan interaction to provide a weekly multi-dimensional ranking of artist popularity."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>8.First Group Since The Beatles To Have 3 Billboard No. 1's Within A Year</h3>
            <br>
            <p>After Love Yourself: Answer went No. 1 on the Billboard 200 in August 2018, BTS earned a third No. 1 album with Map of the Soul: Persona in April 2019.

                Love Yourself: Tear, Love Yourself: Answer, and Map of the Soul: Persona were all released and hit No. 1 within 12 months, which is a huge achievement. The last group to do so was The Beatles, who had three No. 1 albums between November 1995 and October 2016.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>9.First Album By a Korean Artist to Top the U.K. Official Albums Chart</h3>
            <br>
            <p>After BTS' Love Yourself: Tear, Love Yourself: Her, and Love Yourself: Answer reached No. 8, No. 14, and No. 14 respectively on U.K.'s Official Album chart, the band finally hit No. 1 with Map of the Soul: Persona in April 2019 — the first Korean act to do so.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h2>10.First Korean Act to Receive Gold Certification from the RIAA</h2>
            <br>
            <p>BTS' Love Yourself trilogy ended with a bang, as Love Yourself: Answer recorded half a million units and helped BTS become the first Korean act to receive a gold album certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>11.Highest Sales Ever for an Album on Gaon Music Chart</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Less than three months after BTS released Love Yourself: Answer on Aug. 24, 2018, Love Yourself: Answer recorded 2.03 million sales on Korea’s Gaon Music Chart (basically Korea's version of the Billboard charts), making it the highest-selling album in history in Korea.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>12.First Asian Artist to Surpass Five Billion Streams on Spotify</h3>
            <br>
            <p>BTS is the first K-Pop group and the first Asian artist overall to surpass 5 billion streams on Spotify. The feat coincided with the release of Map of the Soul: Persona.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>13.Most-Streamed K-Pop Song on Spotify</h3>
            <br>
            <p>On Oct. 2, Forbes reported that BTS' "Boy With Luv," featuring Halsey, was played on Spotify almost 285 million times, making it the most-streamed K-Pop song ever on the platform.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>14.1 million albums sold in first week on Hanteo Chart</h3>
            <br>
            <p>BTS set a new record on Hanteo Chart when “Love Yourself: Tear” recorded over 1 million units sold within the first week after its release. They are the first artist to sell 1 million units of an album in its first week since the chart began in 1993.

                This also made BTS a “double million seller,” after “Love Yourself: Her” reached 1 million copies sold last year.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>15.According to the Guinness Book of World Records, they have the most Twitter engagement… ever. </h3>
            <br>
            <p>South Korean boy band BTS will appear in the 2019 edition of Guinness World Records - twice.

                The group have the record for the most Twitter engagements, with each tweet having an average of 330,624 retweets, replies, likes or other interactions.
                
                The previous record was held by Harry Styles, with an average of 147,653.
                
                The pop idols' song DNA also has the record for the most viewed music video online in 24 hours by a K-pop group, with 21 million views.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6">
            <h3>16.First Korean Act to Present at the Grammy Awards</h3>
            <br>
            <p>BTS' appearance at the 2019 Grammy Awards was historic, as they were the first Korean act to present an award on the show. The group handed over Best R&B album to H.E.R, whom they are big fans of. If their history with award shows is anything to go by, we may see BTS become the first K-Pop artist to win a Grammy one day as well!

                Those were just 16 records BTS has broken, but I know there are wayyyy more. If I were to go through all of them, it would take forever, especially because it seems these guys will keep breaking records every day.</p>
